      <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

        Hi! I am Kelvin Pehrson P. Kierulf. Currently a 3rd Year Computer
        Science Student at Cebu Institute of Technology.
        <br></br>
        My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in programming
        languages such as C++, Java, and Kotlin, as well as database management
        with MySQL.
        {/* <br></br> */}
        Beyond my academic achievements, I have actively sought opportunities to
        apply my skills to real-world projects. Notably, I led the UI/UX
        implementation, API integration, and quality assurance for "Asa Ta Bai,"
        a Jeepney Information Mobile App. Additionally, I independently
        designed, developed, and deployed "Camera Connect," a mobile and desktop
        application that enables mobile phone cameras to be used as desktop
        webcams. These experiences have honed my ability to work both
        independently and collaboratively, manage project timelines, and deliver
        effective solutions.
        <br></br>
        My technical skills include C++, Java, Flutter, PHP, C, MySQL, Dart, and
        Kotlin. I am also proficient in essential soft skills such as
        communication, teamwork, team building, and documentation.
